 # Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 🔍 Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring **Requirement Analysis**, a fundamental phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

Requirement Analysis helps gather, document, and prioritize the needs of stakeholders to ensure the final product is both functional and user-focused. In this repo, you'll find:

- 📌 Definitions and types of requirements (functional & non-functional)
- 🛠️ Tools and techniques for requirement elicitation
- ✅ Examples of use case diagrams, user stories, and validation techniques
- 💡 Real-world application in project planning and design

This is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum to build strong foundations in planning software systems effectively.

 What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where stakeholders' needs, expectations, and objectives are identified, gathered, analyzed, documented, and validated. It acts as the foundation for all subsequent development activities, ensuring that the final software solution aligns with business goals and user expectations.

📌 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Clarifies Stakeholder Needs
Requirement analysis helps bridge the gap between users (non-technical) and developers (technical) by defining what the software should do.

Reduces Risk of Failure
By identifying the correct requirements early, teams can avoid costly rework, delays, or project failure.

Improves Project Planning
Well-defined requirements allow for better estimation of cost, time, and resources.

Ensures Testability and Traceability
Each requirement can be traced and tested to ensure it has been implemented correctly.

🔍 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Elicitation: Gathering requirements from stakeholders using interviews, surveys, workshops, etc.

Requirement Documentation: Creating artifacts such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, and use case diagrams.

Requirement Validation: Ensuring all documented requirements are accurate, complete, and agreed upon by stakeholders.

Requirement Prioritization: Determining which features or functions are most critical to deliver value early.

🧩 Types of Requirements
Functional Requirements: What the system should do (e.g., user registration, data processing).

Non-Functional Requirements: How the system should perform (e.g., performance, security, usability).

✅ This phase is essential to building software that works — not just technically, but also from a user and business perspective.
