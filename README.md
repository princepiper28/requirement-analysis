 # Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 🔍 Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring **Requirement Analysis**, a fundamental phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

Requirement Analysis helps gather, document, and prioritize the needs of stakeholders to ensure the final product is both functional and user-focused. In this repo, you'll find:

- 📌 Definitions and types of requirements (functional & non-functional)
- 🛠️ Tools and techniques for requirement elicitation
- ✅ Examples of use case diagrams, user stories, and validation techniques
- 💡 Real-world application in project planning and design

This is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum to build strong foundations in planning software systems effectively.
